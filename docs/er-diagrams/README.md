# Entity relationship diagrams (ER)

### Conventions:

- draw.io.
- Attributes which are not PK/FK are not listed in the entity boxes.
- Complete list of tables can be viewed in `/docs/queries`.
- It would be best to have the arrows go directly between foreign and primary keys.
- Each new version of the current EMR state diagram should be named [month-day-year].
