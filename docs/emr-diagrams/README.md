# Entity Model Relationship Diagrams (EMR)

### Credit:

Diagrams created at draw.io: https://app.diagrams.net/#G1h-yuoNWj9aU7WmQRq7n9vsiOEgyOTk1-.

### Conventions:

- Attributes which are not PK/FK are not listed in the entity boxes.
- Complete list of tables can be viewed in `/docs/queries`.
- It would be best to have the arrows go directly between foreign and primary keys.
- Each new version of the current EMR state diagram should be named [month-day-year].
